- Built multi-threaded NLP pipelines to extract signals from unstructured financial text, integrating chunking, embedding generation, vector indexing, and SPLADE search to support research across millions of documents.
- Developed an internal LLM-driven research assistant using RAG, hybrid dense/sparse retrieval, and on-demand prompt orchestration, enabling avg 10ms semantic lookup and accelerating internal research workflows.
- Developed credit transition–matrix models from multi-million–record loan tape datasets to estimate borrower migration, delinquency paths, and downgrade/default probabilities, providing inputs for credit-risk assessment and fixed-income portfolio valuation.
- Optimized Monte Carlo simulation workflows for risk analysis via parallelized computation with Numba and Cython, achieving 15× runtime improvement and 100× speed-up over Excel benchmarks.
